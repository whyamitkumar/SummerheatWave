# SUMMER HEAT WAVES MOBILE ALERT SYSTEM

# Objective
The Summer Heat Waves Mobile Alert System aims to provide timely and effective alerts to the public, especially vulnerable populations, during extreme
heat conditions. This system will help reduce the negative impacts of heat waves by disseminating critical information and precautions through mobile 
devices.

# Key Components:

*Data Collection*
   
{Sources}:
1. Weather data from meteorological agencies (e.g., NOAA, NASA).
2. Historical weather data to train AI models.
3. Real-time weather data for live predictions.

{Methods}:
1. APIs to gather real-time weather data.
2. Databases to store historical and real-time data.

*AI Model Development*

{Tasks}:
1. Predictive modeling to forecast heat waves.
2. Anomaly detection to identify unusual temperature spikes.

{Techniques}:
1. Time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM networks).
2. Machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

 *Alert Dissemination*

{Channels}:
1. Mobile push notifications.
2. SMS alerts.
3. Email notifications.

{Criteria}:
1. Define thresholds for heat wave alerts (e.g., temperature exceeds 35Â°C for more than 3 consecutive days).
2. Use AI predictions to trigger alerts.

{Integration}:
1. Use a backend server to handle AI predictions and trigger alerts.
2. Utilize services like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications.
3. Integrate with SMS APIs (e.g., Twilio) for SMS alerts.

*User Interface Design*

{Components}:
1. Mobile app for user interaction.
2. Dashboard for monitoring alerts and data.

{Features}:
1. Display current weather conditions.
2. Show heat wave predictions.
3. Provide safety tips and guidelines.
4. Allow users to set personal thresholds for alerts.

{Tools}:
1. Mobile development frameworks (e.g., Flutter, React Native).
2. Backend services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud).

# Steps : 

# Data Preprocessing:
  1. Clean and normalize data.
  2. Handle missing values.
# Model Training:
  1. Use historical data to train models.
  2. Validate models using cross-validation.
# Model Evaluation:
  1. Test models on unseen data.
  2. Use metrics like RMSE, MAE, or accuracy to evaluate performance.
